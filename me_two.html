    There are a few trip I took to ski since last year. I just learned skiing 
    and I am in love with this sport, 
    eventhough I sill can't finish a black lane (the most difficult one) by myself, 
    I feel like I am getting addicted to it now.

            I love to have Claypot rice occasionally. 
            Esspecially the bottom of the rice is overcooked and they will become crispy, 
            I always eat that part first then mix the rest of the rice with the meat and sauce.
