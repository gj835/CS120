    There are a few trip I took to ski since last year. I just learned skiing 
    and I am in love with this sport, 
    eventhough I sill can't finish a black lane (the most difficult one) by myself, 
    I feel like I am getting addicted to it now.

                I love to have Claypot rice occasionally. 
                Esspecially the bottom of the rice is overcooked and become crispy,
