    <!-- Problem 1:  
        Ask the user separately for their first name and last name.  
        (Use two calls to prompt()). 
        
        Display the response in a popup (alert): "Your name is <name>" filling in their full name. 
        
        Now ask the user for the number of children they have. 
        
        Display the number of children as a grammatically correct sentence 
        ( “You have no children”, “You have 1 child” or “You have 2 children”, etc). 
        
        This display should be on the page.
